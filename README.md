This GitHub CLI Extension lists all Licences used in your software projects.

It scans all organizations you are part of and all included repositories for dependencies (via DependaBot) and extracts the generated Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). 
Based on the listed dependencies it lists each repo with its Lincences used.

Hacked together.
